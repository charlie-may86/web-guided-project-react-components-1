/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules when DECLARING a React component ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - Name is capitalized
  - Takes an object ("props") as its one argument
  - Must return SOMETHING (null, empty string, elements...)
  - React provides some built-in components that return HTML elements (h1, div, span...)
  - Attribute names with dashes are camelCased (except data- & aria-)
  - The `class` attribute is `className`, `for` attribute is `htmlFor`
  - We can INTERPOLATE ðŸ”¥ js expressions ðŸ”¥ using curly brackets
  - We interpolate attribute values and content
*/

/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules when USING a React component ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - Components are utilized (invoked?) so we may obtain elements
  - Instead of invoking the component with parens, we invoke with < />
  - Instead of passing args with parens, we pass them with attribute-like syntax
  - Don't forget all tags need to close correctly
